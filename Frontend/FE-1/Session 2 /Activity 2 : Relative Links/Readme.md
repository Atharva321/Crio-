In the root folder of your sandbox create a file index.html
Add to this index.html file 
h1 heading  - "Index of Crio FE-1 Sprint"
Create a list of two h3 headings with folder names - Session 1, Session 2
Using anchor tags with relative urls, link the session names to the index.html files of respective sessions, i.e. Clicking on Session 1 should route the user to /Session_1/index.html
Similarly on each page add an anchor tag at the end of the page saying "Back to index" and link it to the root index.html page.
