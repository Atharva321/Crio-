      <h3 style="color: #69a18e;">By James Clear</h3>
      <p style="color: #966171;">
        ‘A supremely practical and useful book. James Clear distils the most
        fundamental information about habit formation, so you can accomplish
        more by focusing on less. ’ Mark Manson, author of The Subtle Art of Not
        Giving A F*ck________________________________People say when you want to
        change your life, you need to set big goals. But they’re wrong.
        World-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered a simpler system
        for transforming your life. He knows that lasting change comes from the
        compound effect of hundreds of small decisions – doing two push-ups a
        day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.
        He calls them atomic habits. In this ground-breaking book, Clear reveals
        how these tiny changes will help you get 1 percent better every day. He
        uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit
        Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to
        entering the Goldilocks Zone) and delves into cutting-edge psychology
        and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells
        inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs and
        distinguished scientists who have used the science of small habits to
        stay productive, motivated and happy. These small changes will have a
        revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships and your life.
        ________________________________‘James Clear has spent years honing the
        art and studying the science of habits. This engaging, hands-on book is
        the guide you need to break bad routines and make good ones. ’ Adam
        Grant, author of Originals‘A special book that will change how you
        approach your day and live your life. ’ Ryan Holiday, author of The
        Obstacle is the Way

      <h3 style="color: #69a18e;">By Cal Newport</h3>
      <p style="color: #966171;">
        Cal Newport discusses in his new book, Deep Work: Rules For Focused
        Success In A Distracted World, about how professionals of today have
        started valuing quantity over quality; and how this has turned young
        professionals of today into puppets who try to indulge in extensive
        multitasking, dealing with multiple emails and projects. This prevents
        them from doing 'deep work'; which is focused work free from all other
        distractions. This also means that the professionals of today should
        sort out their priorities. Newport uses principles of psychology and
        neuroscience to enhance his points. He elaborates how to improve a
        person's cognitive abilities and how employers should encourage workers
        to not take shortcuts for completing projects. He claims that the best
        way to break away from the corporate race is to take a break from
        technology and social media and use some alone-time to rewind and
        introspect. Newport enforces the beliefs of a non-technophile to deliver
        work that is productive and efficiently delivered.

      <h3 style="color: #69a18e;">By Brian Tracy</h3>
      <p style="color: #966171;">
        There just isn't enough time for everything on our to-do list?and there
        never will be. Successful people don't try to do everything. They learn
        to focus on the most important tasks and make sure those get done. They
        eat their frogs.There's an old saying that if the first thing you do
        each morning is eat a live frog, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing
        you're done with the worst thing you'll have to do all day. For Tracy,
        eating a frog is a metaphor for tackling your most challenging task?but
        also the one that can have the greatest positive impact on your life.
        Eat That Frog! shows you how to organize each day so you can zero in on
        these critical tasks and accomplish them efficiently and effectively.In
        this fully revised and updated edition, Tracy adds two new chapters. The
        first explains how you can use technology to remind yourself of what is
        most important and protect yourself from what is least important. The
        second offers advice for maintaining focus in our era of constant
        distractions, electronic and otherwise. But one thing remains unchanged:
        Brian Tracy cuts to the core of what is vital to effective time
        management: decision, discipline and determination. This life-changing
        book will ensure that you get more of your important tasks done?today!
